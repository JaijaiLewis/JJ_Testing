Bovitz, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of all research participants.  Bovitz, Inc. conducts online research, phone surveys, and qualitative research for leading companies across a variety of industries each day.  Our clients use the results of this research to better understand the attitudes, needs, and preferences of consumers regarding a variety of products and services.  Consumers participating in our research projects influence the development and/or improvement of leading brands and services in a number of categories.
<p>In order to maintain our reputation as a professional research provider, Bovitz, Inc. is committed to maintaining the highest research standards in the industry.  We take this responsibility very seriously and we strictly adhere to the privacy policies of the Council of American Survey Research Organizations ("CASRO"), which are posted online at <a href=http://www.casro.org/codeofstandards.cfm target=_blank>http://www.casro.org/codeofstandards.cfm</a>.
<p>Bovitz, Inc. keeps the personal information and the survey responses of each respondent confidential.  The responses of all research participants are combined and the results are shared with clients in aggregate.  The identity of research participants will never be revealed unless the respondent has specifically given Bovitz, Inc. permission.
<p>We will never sell, share, rent, or otherwise intentionally transfer respondents' personal information to our clients, other market research companies, or any other company or individual.  Some research projects may include an option for respondents to be contacted by the sponsoring company; in which case the contact information for those respondents who have elected to be contacted will be shared with the appropriate parties.  Respondents who have won a sweepstakes or drawing associated with some studies may also have their contact information shared for the purposes of distributing the prize.
<p>Bovitz, Inc. abides by the highest standards of Internet privacy.  Specifically:
<ul><li>We never intentionally "spam" Internet users to seek their participation in surveys. We will only send e-mail invitations to those we believe have agreed to receive such invitations through prior, independent communications.
<li>Every invitee may "opt-out" of that survey, and not be contacted again.
<li>We maintain a high level of security to prevent outside parties from having access to information electronically transmitted to us by you.
<li>Although we may use cookies to facilitate some surveys, cookies gather no data other than survey responses or flags to indicate participation in certain surveys.
<li>We never knowingly invite children to participate in research studies without taking measures to ensure appropriate parental consent.</ul>
<p>Bovitz, Inc. takes great pride in our commitment to these privacy policies.  If anything is unclear or you have any other questions related to these policies, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@bovitzinc.com?subject=Privacy Policy Inquiry">info@bovitzinc.com</a>.
